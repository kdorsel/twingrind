# tc3profiler

Twincat 3 doesn't have any profiler mechanism. The scripts, implemented within the scope of this repository, aim to add
such functionality in a relative simple way to Twincat 3 applications.
The scope of the project will be adding profiling to methods of function blocks, rather than directly to function blocks. Coming from OOP we hardly use function blocks directly in our code base. 
Also, we focus on profiles of 1 cycle rather than profiling over a given timespan.

Currently this is work in progress, but the general idea is as follows

1. provide a simple profiler library anyone can add to their application (not started)
2. add calls to the library for all methods in a given application. ( > profiler_guards.py ) These calls are used to generated a callstack of any application.
3. provide a script that triggers a single profile measurement and then reads the callstack generated by our "profile guards" via ADS  The callstack is then stored on disk for later usage (not started)
4. provide a script that reads the graphs (created by 3.) from disk and converts the callstack to the callgrind profile format, version 1 (http://kcachegrind.sourceforge.net/html/CallgrindFormat.html)

The profile can then be visualized by qcachegrind.
